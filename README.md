There is a gender imbalance in the distribution with male respondents at 74.29% and females at 25.71% showing the profession appeals more to the male gender.
Average salary is balanced between the two genders.

In regards to data professions, Data scientists stand out with the highest average salary, followed closely by data engineers and architects. Entry-level roles such as students earn much lower salaries, reflecting career stage differences.
The results highlight that career progression strongly influences salary levels in the data field.

In regards to programming language preference, Python dominates as the most favored programming language with over 400 respondents choosing it. R is the next popular option, while languages like java and C/C++ and JavaScript are less common.
